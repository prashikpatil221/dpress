    <string name="stop">Take a Breath
Focusing on your breathing slows down the adrenaline response and the distressing thoughts.
Breathe mindfully and notice the sensations of breathing into your belly.
        You might find it helpful to count your breaths, or to breath in to a count of 4, and
out to a count of 4.</string>
    <string name="stop2">Observe
Your thoughts and feelings.
For example
Im anxious
My body alarm system has been triggered
My mind is tricking me into believing Im in danger
Im feeling really tense and
hyped up</string>
